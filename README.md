 <h1>DESCRIPTION 📖</h1>

# 👩🏾‍💻🏳️‍🌈Marcia Mijnhijmer🏳️‍🌈👩🏾‍💻 Goes Console! 

Task: to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset.

- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

- The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

  - You will need to track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then find the average.
  - (`Total/(Number of months - 1)`)

- The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

- The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

### Financial Analysis
----------------
Total Months: 86 <br/>
Total: $38382578 <br/>
Average Change: -2315.12 <br/>
Greatest Increase in Profits/Losses: Feb-2012 ($1926159) <br/>
Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses: Sep-2013 ($-2196167) <br/>

- Your final code should print the analysis to the console.
  
# CUSTOM MODIFICATIONS
- I have incorporated the option to show the outcomes in HTML to test my knowledge and further learning.<br/>
- I have also implemented a while loop to prompt users for their input, allowing them to choose which data they would like to see displayed, so that the visulisation of the data is a bit more interactive
